# Demand Forecasting in U.S. Supply Chains

This project provides a comprehensive approach to demand forecasting within U.S. supply chains, emphasizing the use of advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning models to predict demand patterns accurately. The primary goal is to enhance inventory management and optimize supply chain operations, ensuring businesses can meet customer demands effectively while minimizing costs.

## Project Overview

The notebook guides users through the complete workflow of demand forecasting, starting from data exploration to model evaluation and insights generation. By leveraging historical data, it highlights critical trends and relationships that can inform decision-making in supply chain management. The project aims to serve as a robust template for businesses and data scientists seeking to implement data-driven forecasting solutions.

## Key Features and Workflow

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This step delves into the dataset to uncover meaningful patterns and insights. Visualizations are employed to identify seasonal trends, demand fluctuations, and potential outliers. The EDA process lays the groundwork for understanding the data and preparing it for modeling.

### Data Preprocessing
To ensure optimal model performance, extensive preprocessing steps are undertaken. These include handling missing values, treating outliers, and applying necessary data transformations. Scaling and normalization techniques are also employed to standardize the dataset, making it suitable for machine learning algorithms.

### Machine Learning Models
The project incorporates a range of machine learning models to provide accurate demand forecasts. These include:
- **Linear Regression**: A baseline model to establish initial performance benchmarks.
- **Decision Trees**: For capturing non-linear relationships in the data.
- **Random Forest**: A robust ensemble method that enhances prediction accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting**: For fine-tuned, high-performance forecasting.

Each model is rigorously evaluated using performance metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to determine their effectiveness in predicting demand.

### Forecasting and Insights
The final step involves generating demand forecasts based on the selected models and interpreting the results. Insights are drawn to aid in strategic decision-making, focusing on improving inventory turnover, reducing stockouts, and optimizing supply chain efficiency.
